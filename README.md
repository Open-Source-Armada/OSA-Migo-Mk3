# OSA-Migo-Mk3
A cheap 2 gun meta fighter, an experiment in making a small ship while maintaining meta armour techniques. Comes in autocannon, laser and plasma variants.  

//Specs//


2 mounted weapons with a staggered fire trigger system.

Shoot_1+ and Shoot_2+ are your triggers, bind these to your weapon hotkey (space by default).

Rapidfire button switches between staggered fire (gun 2 will stagger behind gun 1 creating a machine gun effect) and alpha strike (both guns fire together).

BoostMin and BoostMax act as a aim keybind without yolo (yolo is avoided where possible due to the 0.2 delay) these should ALWAYS be bound to the same key.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw.

This can be altered to be the more common method of aiming, having higher sense as standard, and having the ships pitch/yaw slow down for aiming.
(Swap the BoostMin/BoostMax Off values with its On values, remember to set it in the pitch/yaw lever fields too)

Armoured using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating and plasma/rail sacrifice plates.

Its primarlily plated using alloys, char is used in the prow mounted gun armour (voxel armour).

142 m/s max speed using T2 thrusters.

502681.312 kg in weight.

Two small prop tanks for 2 million prop, 1 hours 20 mins estimated flight time.

1 T1 fuel chamber, 1 T1 generators, 3 T1 enhancers.

Uses basic FCU, no reverse, roll is performed using Roll_L and Roll_R buttons, this is to allow fast handling by isolating the roll thrusters from the FCU/MFC.

Entry is through a small gap on both sides of the glass.

//Tactics//


"bigger is better" is very often the name of the game in starbase.

This does not help the new combat pilot/designer when starting out, but only those with skill issues ignore the value of micro fighters.

The first advantage is low cost, this ship can be swarm built by players starting out or by expirenced players/corps.

This is important for lowering the risk of PvP, allowing even the newest of pilots to get flight time in combat.

The second advantage is tempo, micro swarms are constant, hard to hit, and a waste of time to focus fire, giving new pilots breathing room is large battles.

When used to suplement larger fighters, these micro's act as a reserve fleet for downed pilot of bigger ships, keeping the tempo of the fight in your favor.

The third advantage is dogfights in gravity, the larger the ship, the harder it is to orbit fight without loosing altitude.

When fighting larger ships, they will have to pitch/yaw or apply strafe thrust to manage grav, where as you wont need to nearly as much,
flying low to the ground will allow you to force this, causeing the larger ship to break off to manage altitude, the perfect chance for you to score free hits.

It is also better to engage endos is smaller ships, as there is little risk of boarding, and large ships have better things to shoot at.


//Design//


This ship is made to compromise as little as possible in the method or armouring i know, despite its small size.

Armour is front facing to survive orbit fights, this ship should have a great advantage against other ships of its class, can tank larger ships as well.

Side, top, bottom and thruster plates are made of the largest possible, to increase the "Magic Health" of the plates.

Large triangle plates are used as much as possible due to them having great performance againts all mounted weapons, pound for pound best all round plate.

Front of the ship is composed of stacked large plates, made of char, that surround the guns and is the core armour located at the front.

As well as having high magic health, the direction the plates are stacked to take advantage of the voxel damage system.

When a plates health is broken, it will begin taking voxel damage, by stacking the plates lenghtways you ensure the projectile must pass through as much material as possible.

Plates (even small plates) can resist multiple rounds on top of there magic health, if the plate is broken but still on the ship, it wil continue to provide some protection.

This method is best against lasers, as magic health is quickly destroyed by laser weapons and above.

It is also segmented, meaning that that the damage will be spread accross mutiple plates instaed of one, reducing the chance of well aimed burst penertrating your armour.

Surrounding this voxel armour are more large triangles, to cover up the angles the voxel plates will not apply it effects.

Along the very prow of the ship are bastonium railings, this is sacrifice plating to assorb damage from plasma/railguns.

Unlike lasers, plasma and railguns excell at breaking large plate health AND voxel armour, while lacking crit chance on explosive components.

Without sacrifice plating, it is only a matter of time before you armour is gone and your ship is rendered unflyable.

Where plasma/rails do not do well against is ironicaly, small plates, as the shatter damage dealt struggles to spread from plate to plate.

This means using smaller plates on the outer layer is in fact a great technique, and can protect your core armour from deadly alpha strikes with late game weapons.

These plates still help with lower tier weapon fire.

This ship has autocannon, laser and plasma versions, i consider higher tier weapons to hold less value on smaller ships vs big, so use to your taste.

This ship is not max speed as it would require a massive nerf to the voxel armour, leaving the ship vulnrable to lasers, i encourage expirementing with the plate mats.
